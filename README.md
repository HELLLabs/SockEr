# SockEr, a nifty websockets based counter ⌛️

This is a nifty li'l tool (simple counter) that gets synced across various devices via WebSockets. 

## Usage?
Very simple, just deploy this application on your server and open the link where it is served. Now you can use multiple devices to open the same link and the counter on all of them will be synced, particulary useful to use in event management where you want to count the number of entries manually in a distributed arragements of volunteers, this was exactly the case we built this tool for!
